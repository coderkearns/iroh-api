The Boy in the Iceberg, I won't get to finish my game?
The Boy in the Iceberg, Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?
The Boy in the Iceberg,I'm going to bed now. Yep, a man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
The Boy in the Iceberg, Again.
The Boy in the Iceberg, No! Power in firebending comes from the breath, not the muscles. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! Get it right this time.
The Boy in the Iceberg,No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics. Drill it again!
The Boy in the Iceberg, Very well, but first, I must finish my roast duck. 
The Avatar Returns, Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?
The Avatar Returns, Duh? Huh?
The Avatar Returns, Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.
The Southern Air Temple, You mean the Avatar?
The Southern Air Temple, Retired general.
The Southern Air Temple,Our ship is being repaired.
The Southern Air Temple, Yes. I will do that. It was incredible! What? Did we crash or something?
The Southern Air Temple,Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect. We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.
The Southern Air Temple,Eh.. My fault, entirely.
The Southern Air Temple, More tea, please.
The Southern Air Temple, Prince Zuko, that's enough.
The Southern Air Temple, Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?
The Southern Air Temple,Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.
The Southern Air Temple,Basics, Zuko! Break his root!
The Southern Air Temple,No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat? Disgraceful. Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.
The Southern Air Temple, Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.
The Warriors of Kyoshi, Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.
The Warriors of Kyoshi, Okay then. We have no idea where he is.
The Warriors of Kyoshi,You really should open a window in here.
The Warriors of Kyoshi,Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.
The Warriors of Kyoshi, Are you going to finish that?
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World, Over here!
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself. 
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Very well! 
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Who's there? A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one. It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Where are you taking me?
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Right, but where, specifically?
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. And I'm still tired.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Excellent form, Prince Zuko.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 1: The Spirit World,Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku, Sailing into Fire Nation waters... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku, Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you? What if you're caught?
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku,You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku, Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku,Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku,Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar.
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku,We're on a collision course!
Winter Solstice%2C Part 2: Avatar Roku,Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.
The Waterbending Scroll,Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko. 
The Waterbending Scroll,Even more urgent. It seems, I- -I have lost my lotus tile. 
The Waterbending Scroll,For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.
The Waterbending Scroll,See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life. I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.
The Waterbending Scroll,I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.
The Waterbending Scroll,Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain! 
The Waterbending Scroll,For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds. Oh, this place looks promising! Oh, that is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?
The Waterbending Scroll,Yeah, it kind of is. 
The Waterbending Scroll,Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
The Waterbending Scroll,It's no proverb! 
The Waterbending Scroll, Maybe it should be a proverb...
The Waterbending Scroll, Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time! 
The Storm,There is a storm coming. A big one.
The Storm,A storm is approaching from the north. I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.
The Storm, Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.
The Storm, He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up.
The Storm, Lucky guess.
The Storm,Easy now. Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better.
The Storm,Do you really want to know?
The Storm,It's okay. May I join you?
The Storm, Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.
The Storm, Prince Zuko, what's wrong?
The Storm, You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.
The Storm,Very well. But you must promise not to speak. These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?
The Storm,Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences. 
The Storm,After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.
The Storm,That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. Zuko would have to duel his own father.
The Storm,When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.
The Storm, I looked away.
The Storm,It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.
The Storm,Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.
The Storm,Look!
The Storm,Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.
The Storm,Your apology is accepted.
The Blue Spirit,Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!
The Blue Spirit,Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him! 
The Blue Spirit, Excellent! I take the pot! But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again.
The Blue Spirit,Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.
The Blue Spirit,Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.
The Blue Spirit,Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.
Bato of the Water Tribe, Aahh! See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being. 
Bato of the Water Tribe,Well, I'm impressed. Very impressed. 
Bato of the Water Tribe, He means no offense! I'm certain you bathe regularly!
Bato of the Water Tribe,Plus, we'll pay your weight in gold.
Bato of the Water Tribe, You got it!
Bato of the Water Tribe,At my age, there's really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.
Bato of the Water Tribe, June! No! 
Bato of the Water Tribe,Shhh.
The Waterbending Master, Winter, spring... Summer, and fall... Winter, spring... Summer, and fall... Four seasons... four loves... Four seasons... for love.
The Waterbending Master,No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.
The Waterbending Master,I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone... even the cook.
The Waterbending Master, No!
The Waterbending Master,Just rumors. I don't think he is real.
The Waterbending Master, The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
The Waterbending Master,It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
The Waterbending Master,Zuko! Zuko...
The Waterbending Master,The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.
The Waterbending Master,Yes... pirates. We had a run-in with them a while back. They wanted revenge.
The Waterbending Master,Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!
The Waterbending Master,Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
The Waterbending Master,No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.
The Waterbending Master,Someone's coming. Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck. 
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1, Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1, I hope not, for your sake.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1, We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1,It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack. The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak. 
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1,If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1,I'm sorry. I just nag you, because... well, ever since I lost my son...
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1,... I think of you as my own.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1,Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 1,And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2,I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2, Remove the moon? How?
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2,What?
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2, Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2, He is right Zhao.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2, I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2, You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2,I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.
The Siege of the North%2C Part 2,Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.
The Avatar State,This is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense? I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?
The Avatar State,I'm sure he doesn't. Why would he banish you if he didn't care? Uh, that came out wrong, didn't it? 
The Avatar State, Look at these magnificent shells! I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.
The Avatar State, To what do we owe this honor?
The Avatar State,I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment.
The Avatar State, It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything.
The Avatar State, I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.
The Avatar State,Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem.
The Avatar State, Wait! Don't leave without me!
The Avatar State,Family sticks together, right? 
The Avatar State, Zuko! Let's go!
The Avatar State,I think we're safe here.
The Cave of Two Lovers, You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous.
The Cave of Two Lovers, Hmm... delectable tea? Or deadly poison?
The Cave of Two Lovers,Zuko, remember that plant I thought might be tea?
The Cave of Two Lovers,I did... and it wasn't. 
The Cave of Two Lovers, When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing. But look what I found. These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade. That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness.
The Cave of Two Lovers,But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation. 
The Cave of Two Lovers, But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.
The Cave of Two Lovers, Whoops!
The Cave of Two Lovers, Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior. 
The Cave of Two Lovers, Where do you live exactly?
The Cave of Two Lovers,Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.
The Cave of Two Lovers, Much practice.
The Cave of Two Lovers,Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.
The Cave of Two Lovers,What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.
The Swamp, Spare coins for weary travelers?
The Swamp,They will if you ask nicely. Spare change for a hungry old man?
The Swamp,The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!
The Swamp, Not professional anyway. It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!
The Swamp, They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!
The Swamp, Such a kind man.
Avatar Day, Where did you get these?
Avatar Day, Mmmm...... mmmm!
Avatar Day,Looks like you did some serious shopping. But where did you get the money?
Avatar Day,To be honest with you, the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.
Avatar Day,Zuko... Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.
Avatar Day,No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.
Avatar Day, You did? Good, good.
Avatar Day, Wait!
Zuko Alone, If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold. I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first! 
The Chase,Ow... That really hurt my tailbone.
The Chase, Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.
The Chase, Perhaps I am.
The Chase,I wasn't thinking that.
The Chase,I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.
The Chase,You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you.
The Chase,I've been tracking him actually.
The Chase, Yes, a little bit. His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away.
The Chase,I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.
The Chase,My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
The Chase,I'm glad.
The Chase,Get up!
Bitter Work,My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.
Bitter Work,Somehow, that's not so surprising. 
Bitter Work, Good. That was very... uhhh... bracing. 
Bitter Work, No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down. It's time to resume your training.
Bitter Work,Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.
Bitter Work,Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning. 
Bitter Work,Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.
Bitter Work,I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.
Bitter Work,Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.
Bitter Work,Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.
Bitter Work,I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself. 
Bitter Work,Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.
Bitter Work,It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole. 
Bitter Work,It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.
Bitter Work,Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.
Bitter Work,If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?
Bitter Work,Come on, you've got to feel the flow. Excellent! You've got it!
Bitter Work,What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!
Bitter Work,Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!
The Serpent's Pass,Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace... as a tourist!
The Serpent's Pass,What sort of king is he eating like?
The Serpent's Pass,So, Smellerbee. That's an unusual name for a young man.
The Serpent's Pass, Oh, now I see. It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!
The Serpent's Pass,It is a magnificent sight.
The Serpent's Pass,Once. When I was a... different man.
The Serpent's Pass,That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.
The Drill,It's pronounced Mushi.
The Drill, Uh, no, no. But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom. Your beauty is intoxicating.
The Drill, Ooh! Jasmine please.
The Drill,Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!
The Drill,Hey!
The Drill, I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but... it's just so sad!
The Drill,What a handsome baby. 
City of Walls and Secrets,I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend! 
City of Walls and Secrets,Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not. Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon!
City of Walls and Secrets,Uh, does this possibly come in a larger size? 
City of Walls and Secrets, Blech! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!
City of Walls and Secrets, How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?! We'll have to make some major changes around here.
City of Walls and Secrets,Would you like a pot of tea?
City of Walls and Secrets, "Sick of tea?" That's like being sick of breathing! Have you seen the spark rocks to heat up the water?
City of Walls and Secrets, I borrowed our neighbors'. Such kind people.
City of Walls and Secrets, The secret ingredient is love. 
City of Walls and Secrets,Please, son, you're confused! You don't know what you're doing!
City of Walls and Secrets, This poor boy is confused. We're just simple refugees.
City of Walls and Secrets, Oh, ho, ho. That's very sweet.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se,No, it's not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion. The moon flower likes partial shade. 
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se,It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se,But not this time. Run!
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, What are you doing?
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, With that stance?
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over. 
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Of course!
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Happy birthday, my son. If only I could have helped you. Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, You're right, Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot. Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.
The Tales of Ba Sing Se, He'd love to!
The Tales of Ba Sing Se,How was your night, Prince Zuko?
Appa's Lost Days, Uh, it's nothing. Go back to sleep. 
Lake Laogai,Good tea is its own reward.
Lake Laogai, My own tea shop? This is a dream come true!
Lake Laogai,I even get to name the shop?
Lake Laogai,Did you hear, nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the Upper Ring of the city!
Lake Laogai,So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.
Lake Laogai, We have a chance for a new life here. If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.
Lake Laogai,There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why.
Lake Laogai,What that means is up to you. The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid.
Lake Laogai,So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask...
Lake Laogai,I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?
Lake Laogai, And then what!? You never think these things through! This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go!
Lake Laogai,No! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!
Lake Laogai,Is it your own destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?
Lake Laogai,I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do you want?
Lake Laogai,You did the right thing, nephew. Leave it behind.
The Earth King,You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.
The Earth King,Zuko! 
The Earth King,You're burning up. You have an intense fever. This will help cool you down.
The Earth King, Here's some clean water to drink. Stay under the blankets and sweat this out.
The Earth King,You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. 
The Earth King,Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body. 
The Earth King,You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.
The Guru,It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.
The Guru,Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.
The Guru,Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you.
The Guru,I am very thankful.
The Guru,No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know. 
The Guru, Yes, let's make some tea!
The Guru,I'm brewing as fast as I can!
The Guru, I... I can't believe it!
The Guru, Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! 
The Crossroads of Destiny,Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.
The Crossroads of Destiny,Maybe the Earth King overslept.
The Crossroads of Destiny,Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname "The Dragon of the West"?
The Crossroads of Destiny,It's more of a demonstration, really.
The Crossroads of Destiny,Come on! You'll be fine!
The Crossroads of Destiny,I need your help.
The Crossroads of Destiny,May I come in? Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.
The Crossroads of Destiny,She has captured my nephew as well.
The Crossroads of Destiny,I know how you must feel about my nephew. But believe me when I tell you that there is good inside him.
The Crossroads of Destiny,I brought someone along who might help us.
The Crossroads of Destiny, None taken.
The Crossroads of Destiny,The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?
The Crossroads of Destiny,Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.
The Crossroads of Destiny,I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, you will come to a better place.
The Crossroads of Destiny,Zuko, it's time we talked. Go help you other friends. We'll catch up with you. 
The Crossroads of Destiny,You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good.
The Crossroads of Destiny, The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.
The Crossroads of Destiny,Zuko, I am begging you. Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want. 
The Crossroads of Destiny,You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can! 
The Avatar and the Fire Lord, No. He wasn't.
The Avatar and the Fire Lord,You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.
The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.
The Avatar and the Fire Lord,This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.
The Day of Black Sun%2C Part 1: The Invasion, Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.
The Day of Black Sun%2C Part 1: The Invasion,Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable. I think you should take the rest of the day off.
The Day of Black Sun%2C Part 1: The Invasion,You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest.
The Day of Black Sun%2C Part 1: The Invasion, Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon.
The Western Air Temple,What a stunning view.
The Western Air Temple,You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding him here are very slim. 
The Western Air Temple,Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time to heal and rest.
The Western Air Temple, You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.
The Ember Island Players, Prince Zuko, you must try this cake! 
The Ember Island Players, Well, while you do that, maybe I'll capture another slice. 
The Ember Island Players, Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages!
The Ember Island Players,Zuko, it's time we had a talk... about your hair, it's gone too far!
The Ember Island Players, Choose treachery, it's more fun! 
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you had lost your way.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, But you found it again. And you did it by yourself. And I am so happy you found your way here. 
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters,Hmmm...
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, No, Zuko, it won't turn out well.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters,Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war. History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, No. Someone new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and unquestionable honor. It has to be you, Prince Zuko.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters,Yes, you have. You've struggled; you've suffered, but you have always followed your own path. You restored your own honor, and only you can restore the honor of the Fire Nation.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord. When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se. Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation, so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters,Yes. Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation, so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order. But Azula will be there, waiting for you.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters,Not alone! You'll need help.
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, What do you think it is?
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day. 
Sozin's Comet%2C Part 2: The Old Masters, Goodbye, everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. I know it.
Turning the Tides,Tell her we will be arriving in three days' time. And that I look forward to winning back Republic City, together.
Skeletons in the Closet,Hmm... Amon had to know we were coming. So why aren't we meeting any resistance?
Skeletons in the Closet,Something's not right. It's a trick! Water and earthbenders, detonate those mines! What is that sound?
Skeletons in the Closet, Avatar Korra? You saved my life. Thank you.
Skeletons in the Closet,I was prepared to deal with Sato's mecha tanks, but not these new high-speed aircraft.
Skeletons in the Closet,Amon is winning so far, but we're not out of the fight yet.
Skeletons in the Closet, A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them. Do you still have a way to get a message out?
Skeletons in the Closet,Commander Bumi. Second division of the United Forces.
Skeletons in the Closet,Yes, bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet.
Skeletons in the Closet,Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear. Now comes the hard part. We need to ground those aircrafts. Otherwise, Bumi's fleet would never be able to retake the city.
Skeletons in the Closet,Everyone get ready, we leave at dawn.
Skeletons in the Closet,That's not a good plan. We need to stick together.
Skeletons in the Closet,Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone.
Skeletons in the Closet,Hmm... My grandfather would respect the Avatar's instinct. So will I.
Endgame,I think we've found our secret airfield. Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off.
Endgame, I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?
Endgame, I'm going after those airplanes.
Endgame, Thanks for looking out for me, Aang.
Peacekeepers,What can I do?
Peacekeepers,I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to accidentally run into a hostile Northern blockade. We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?
Peacekeepers, Mr. President.
Peacekeepers,Of course not, sir.
Peacekeepers,Crystal, sir.
Peacekeepers, I'm sorry. My hands are officially tied.
Peacekeepers, But you should talk to the Fire Lord. My mother and grandfather have always been good friends with the Avatar, and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help.
A New Spiritual Age,You two look lost. Maybe I can help you.
A New Spiritual Age,I was good friends with Avatar Aang.
A New Spiritual Age,Hello, Korra.
A New Spiritual Age,I'm glad you came to visit us in the Spirit World, Korra. You came just in time. We're having a little tea party, to celebrate May-Jim's wedding. 
A New Spiritual Age,The Spirit World is very mysterious, but so is love. Help yourself to some tea and cakes. They are spirit cakes, so you won't gain any weight- of course, you won't lose any either!
A New Spiritual Age,That's right. It was yours long, long ago. When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the light spirit, Raava, around- until the two of you became one. It is my favorite thing I found here. You know, when you make tea in it, you can still taste a little light in every cup.
A New Spiritual Age,They say that the game of Pai Sho was invented by the spirits... although some of them don't seem to grasp it very well. 
A New Spiritual Age,As you can see, it is a game that requires great patience. But time does not mean much to us here.
A New Spiritual Age,Oh, I've been here for many years. I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits, so when my work was done in the material world, I chose to leave my body behind and come to the Spirit World! It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends. Korra, what's wrong?
A New Spiritual Age,You're not alone Korra, it's okay.
A New Spiritual Age,Korra, please stop! Look at what you're doing to everyone!
A New Spiritual Age,In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because you are the bridge between the two worlds. You must try to stay positive. 
A New Spiritual Age,There, you see?
A New Spiritual Age,Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see.
A New Spiritual Age,I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy.
A New Spiritual Age,Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else. This little fellow needs to go home as well. Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours. 
A New Spiritual Age,The dragon bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak.
A New Spiritual Age,This is something that you must do on your own. The people who have been coming to the Spirit World lately have brought darkness and anger. So that is what you see now. But you have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you. Besides, look at this little fellow. This mountain is his home. When you first met him, you were frightened. But does he seem scary to you now?
A New Spiritual Age,Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them. It was good to meet you. Come visit me again - in this life, or the next.
Darkness Falls,Almost forty years. It's nice to see you again.
Darkness Falls, My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost, I came to show you the way out.
Darkness Falls,I'm sorry to hear that. But you shouldn't be here, Vaatu has escaped and darkness threatens to take over.
Darkness Falls,I understand. But I beg you to be careful, if you travel too deep into the Spirit World, you could end up in a place where only the lost will ever find you.
Light in the Dark,Yes, Mr. President. But I need to know what kind of enemy we're dealing with.
Light in the Dark,Fire!
The Ultimatum,Please don't hurt me, Korra. I'm just an old man.
The Ultimatum,I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection. But instead, I found you. In the Spirit World, you always seem to find something you don't know you were looking for. You look troubled.
The Ultimatum,Sit. What is on your mind?
The Ultimatum,Just because you are the Avatar, doesn't mean you will have all the answers.
The Ultimatum,You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends.
The Ultimatum,Yes, my nephew. Their relationship started off a little rocky, but they grew to become lifelong friends. Best friends.
Kuvira's Gambit, Mister President, do I have your order to engage?
Kuvira's Gambit,Get back to the city before she sees you. And Korra -- --find a way to beat that thing.
